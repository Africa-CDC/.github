# Welcome to @Africa CDC Institute of Pathogen Genomics (IPG)!

## Who we are 

The [Africa CDC Institute of Pathogen Genomics](https://ipg.africacdc.org) was launched in November 2019 to support the adoption and implementation of pathogen genomics and bioinformatics in national public health institutes (NPHIs) across Africa.

IPG is supporting a continental coordinated approach to maximize the benefits of pathogen genomics for more effective outbreak preparedness, prevention and response, and for the control and elimination of endemic diseases in Africa. IPG operates through five [Africa CDC‚Äôs Regional Collaboration Centers (RCCs)](https://africacdc.org/regional-collaborating-centres/) and its Regional Integrated Surveillance and Laboratory Network (RISLNET). The aim is to coordinate a network of NPHIs, academic/research institutions, private and public laboratories, and centers of excellence to support prevention, rapid detection, and response to current and emerging public health threats.
